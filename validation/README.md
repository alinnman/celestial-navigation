# Celestial Navigation Validation Framework

This directory contains the validation framework that demonstrates the accuracy
of the celestial navigation toolkit against NOVAS
(Naval Observatory Vector Astrometry Software).

## Overview

The validation framework proves that the celestial navigation algorithms
achieve **0.2 nautical mile accuracy** when compared against the
U.S. Naval Observatory's reference implementation.

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run validation:**

   ```bash
   sh run_validation.sh -l [test size] -s [random seed]
   ```

3. **View detailed results:**

   ```bash
   cat results/validation_report.txt
   ```

## What Gets Validated

- ✅ **Sight reduction accuracy** - Position calculations within 0.2nm
- ✅ **WGS-84 coordinate transformations** - Geodetic/geocentric conversions
- ✅ **Atmospheric correction handling** - Refraction model accuracy
- ✅ **Multi-star intersection algorithms** - 2-4 star fixes
- ✅ **Global navigation scenarios** - Various latitudes and conditions

## Dependencies

- **NOVAS** - Naval Observatory Vector Astrometry Software
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations
- **Main Toolkit** - Celestial navigation algorithms

## Validation Theory

The validation works by:

1. **Calculating precise star altitudes** using NOVAS for specific
   times/locations
2. **Feeding these altitudes** to our sight reduction algorithms
3. **Comparing calculated positions** with known true positions
4. **Measuring accuracy** in nautical miles

Since NOVAS provides sub-arcsecond accuracy, any errors in our results
indicate algorithmic issues in our toolkit, not reference data problems.

Any test case resulting in **opposing stars** or very
**narrow intersection angles** will be **discarded**.
(Classified as "BAD STAR CHOICE").
This is equivalent to common practice in celestial navigation. The selection is
based on the **fitness sum** algorithm [described here](../README.md#fitness).

## Professional Validation

This validation framework demonstrates that the celestial navigations toolkit:

- **Meets professional standards** - Comparable to commercial navigation
  software
- **Uses correct algorithms** - Validated against Naval Observatory reference
- **Handles real-world scenarios** - Multiple latitudes and star combinations
- **Achieves sub-sextant precision** - Better accuracy than physical
  measurement limits

A consistent 0.2 nm accuracy provides confidence for practical navigation
applications.
