# celestial-navigation
Contains a simple python script to be used for celestial navigation. <br>
Starfixes have to be obtained using a sextant, a nautical almanac and an accurate watch. <br>
The python script takes care of the sight reduction. For two fixes you will get two possible coordinates. For three or more fixes you will get one coordinate (calculated as a mean value). 

The python script only uses basic libraries (no numpy or similar) and could be installed in PyDroid to allow for use on a mobile phone.
