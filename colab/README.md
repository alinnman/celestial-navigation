# Google Colab Notebooks

This folder contains some notebooks to use in
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
Mostly to be used as demos, and these notebooks are of course
not usable in a practical navigation situation without internet
connection.

The notebooks download the core code (starfix.py) and all used astrometric
data dynamically (from github). Input parameters are entered using Google Colab
Forms/Parameters.
