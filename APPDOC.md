## Entering data

### DRP position

DRP (Dead-Reckoning Position) is a rough estimation of your current position.
<br>For a **2-star-fix** sight reduction it is used to select the correct
intersection point.
(A 2-star-fix will alway produce two intersections,
and these can be located far away from each other)
<br>For a **3-star-fix** sight reduction the DRP serves as a way to shorten the
execution time of finding an accurate result.
This effect is however small, but you are advised to
use DRP values anyway. Normally you have at least a rough estimation of your
actual position.

At the top you see fields marked **DRP Latitude** and **DRP Longitude**.
Enter the latitude and longitude for your DRP in these fields.
