# Using the Celeste app

## Installation and prerequisites

The application runs under Android 13 or higher. It is installed using
APK files which you can
[find&nbsp;here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QFcncVEuCQMnls8lyNElDtpTYruMgI0D?usp=sharing).

See [this article](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-APK-Files-on-Android)
for info on how to install APK files on Android.

## Entering data

### DRP position

DRP (Dead-Reckoning Position) is a rough estimation of your current position.
<br>For a **2-star-fix** sight reduction it is used to select the correct
intersection point.
(A 2-star-fix will alway produce two intersections,
and these can be located far away from each other)
<br>For a **3-star-fix** sight reduction the DRP serves as a way to shorten the
execution time of finding an accurate result.
This effect is however small, but you are advised to
use DRP values anyway. Normally you have at least a rough estimation of your
actual position.

At the top you see fields marked **DRP Latitude** and **DRP Longitude**.
Enter the latitude and longitude for your DRP in these fields.

### Star fixes

The input form contains input field for **three** observations (star fixes).

#### Selection of star fix

You need to specify two or three star fixes. The check box **Use this sight**
can be used to eliminate one star fix if you only have two. You can even
use just one star fix but this will result in a failed sight reduction, but
the map view (see below) can be used to present the actual circle of equal
altitude and this can assist you in your work.
