# Why did I write this?

## What is it

This code project was written with these objectives

* Provide for a workable positioning tool when GPS is not available.
* As an exercise for myself in python coding, and elementary maths
(geometry, vector/linear algebra, numerical methods), resulting
in software of high quality.
* Also to explore basic astrometry and routines for celestial navigation.
* As an attempt to give evidence of the **spherical** shape of the Earth.

<i>The latter objective might seem strange, but I have followed some
conspirationist movements during the last year, in particular Flat Earth.
It is very obvious that celestial navigation provides one of the most solid
evidence of a spheric Earth you can ever get,
and this just by staying on the ground (or sail a ship at sea)
using low-tech equipment.
No spaceflight is necessary, it can be performed in your backyard
(using an artificial horizon) and this has been known for many centuries.
By providing this sample I hope to give some more understanding of the concept.

## The scope

The software (and the app) will be provided open-source, and currently I
am not aiming for a commercial approach.

## Learning more

An even better way to learn is of course to study the techniques in the
old-school way, as it has been practitioned on ships for many centuries,
and a good start is to watch this tutorial on Youtube
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDd1es5oQto&list=PLWcAZhCRTMByW_XEQ0y0OlGmxO3jp0LyE)
(Andy Howe). Another very good resource can be found
[here](https://reednavigation.com/) (Frank Reed) where you find
courses, software and more.  

You may also watch a website I wrote dedicated to reasoning and challenging
questions on Earth geometry [here](https://earthform.linnman.net/),
including a special challenge related to Celestial Navigation
[here](https://earthform.linnman.net/bonus-challenge-celestial-navigation).

I have also prepared a simple Google Colab
[notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tCY3mvpLlzUKot2Rul3I4ZobVCzzRBtT?usp=sharing)
to be used in discussions
with flat earthers, to show how celestial navigation works and how powerful
its mechanism is to give evidence for a spheric Earth.

If you want more **rigorous** proofs (including maths) for a spherical Earth you can 
take a look [here](maths/sphere-proof.md)
