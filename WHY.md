# Why did I write this?

This code project was written with these objectives

* Provide for a workable positioning tool when GPS is not available.
* As an exercise for myself in python coding, and elementary maths
(geometry, vector/linear algebra, numerical methods).
* As an attempt to give evidence of the shape of the Earth.

The latter objective might seem strange, but I have followed some
conspirationist movements during the last year, in particular Flat Earth.
It is very obvious that celestial navigation provides one of the most solid
evidence of a spheric Earth you can ever get,
and this just by staying on the ground (or sail a ship at sea).
No spaceflight is necessary, it can be performed in your backyard
(using an artificial horizon) and this has been known for many centuries.
By providing this sample I hope to give some more understanding of the concept.
An even better way to learn is of course to study the techniques in the
old-school way, as it has been practitioned on ships for many centuries,
and a good start is to watch this [tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDd1es5oQto&list=PLWcAZhCRTMByW_XEQ0y0OlGmxO3jp0LyE).
