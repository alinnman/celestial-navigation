# Installation and usage

## Quick Demo

A
[demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bZt35-P6aiPlKWktyXgU3he6Di_N-PpA)
of the code can be run in Google Colab. You can use it to run a standard
three-star fix. A Google account is necessary.

## Installation

The code is installed using just a file copy of the python (.py)
and (optionally) Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) files to a suitable directory.
You may also need the machine-readable nautical almanacs residing in the
<tt>sample_data</tt> subfolder.
Required software base:

* [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)
or higher with core libraries.
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
(needed for machine-readable nautical almanac).
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) (needed for running notebooks).

No other additional libraries are necessary.
This
[link](https://github.com/alinnman/celestial-navigation/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
will download **all** code in a ZIP file.

The python scripts could be installed in
[PyDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3)
to allow for use on an Android mobile phone
(with no need for internet access).
To aid in installation a good file browser is recommended
(for copying and decompressing of ZIP files) such as Cx File Explorer
as described
[here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cxinventor.file.explorer&pcampaignid=web_share).
You are recommended to unzip the file to a specific directory
(not a root directory).
On Android you could create a directory in the "Documents" tree,
e.g. "Documents/work/coding".
Also make sure your PyDroid environment has the Pandas 
(and optionally Jupyter) libraries installed. 
Pydroid has access to <tt>pip</tt>
for installing external libraries.

The script [starfix.py](starfix.py) contains the core routines.

The script [calibration.py](calibration.py) contains a setup of a used sextant,
with a correction for errors.
You are advised to adjust this script for your used sextant.

You are also advised to make copies (and modifications) of the supplied samples
[starfixdata_stat_1.py](starfixdata_stat_1.py)
or [starfixdata_sea_1.py](starfixdata_sea_1.py)
to support your workflow and observations.
There are also Jupyter notebooks availabe, see below.

A Nautical Almanac must be used to get the GP (ground point) of
your observations. If your observations are made from 2024 to 2028
you have a machine-readable almanac available [here](./sample_data).
But you can also use a manual/printed almanac.
Currently PDF almanacs of [2024](NAmod(A4)_2024.pdf),
[2025](NAmod(A4)_2025.pdf),
[2026](NAmod(A4)_2026.pdf),
[2027](NAmod(A4)_2027.pdf)
and [2028](NAmod(A4)_2028.pdf)
are bundled in the repository in a digital version.
But you may of course use a hard-copy of the nautical almanac and
these can be ordered
[here](https://www.amazon.com/s?i=stripbooks&rh=p_27%3AU.K.+Hydrographic&s=relevancerank&text=U.K.+Hydrographic&ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1).
New digital versions (PDF or machine-readable)
can be prepared using some GitHub code repositories,
such as [this one](https://github.com/alinnman/SkyAlmanac-Py3).

The script sample [terrestrial.py](terrestrial.py)
can be used (and modified) if you would like to use your sextant as an aid in
terrestrial navigation.

In addition to the supplied scripts you may also run the code in
[Jupyter&nbsp;Notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter#Jupyter_Notebook).
[Jupyter&nbsp;can&nbsp;be&nbsp;installed&nbsp;in&nbsp;Pydroid](https://www.codementor.io/@olalekanrahman/how-to-access-jupyter-notebook-on-pydroid-1ckw13mtgz),
and this allows for a convenient way to keep your workflow in an easily
managed web interface. The notebook web interface can be launched from specific
launch scripts (launch.xxx.py).
