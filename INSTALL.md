# Installation

The code is installed using just a file copy of the python (.py) files to a suitable directory. No additional libraries are necessary. 
Python 3.11 is required. 

The python script could be installed in [PyDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3) to allow for use on a mobile phone 
(with no need for internet access). 

You are advised to make copies of the supplied samples starfixdata.chicago.py or starfix.sea.py to support your workflow and observations.
