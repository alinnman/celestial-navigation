# Installation

The code is installed using just a file copy of the python (.py) files to a suitable directory. No additional libraries are necessary. 
Python 3.11 is required. 

The python script could be installed in [PyDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3) to allow for use on a mobile phone 
(with no need for internet access). 

You are advised to make copies of the supplied samples starfixdata.chicago.py or starfix.sea.py to support your workflow and observations. 

The Nautical Almanac must be used manually to get the GP (ground point) of your observations. Currently the almanac of 2024 is bundled in the repository in a digital version. 
But you may of course use a hard-copy of the nautical almanac and these can be ordered [here](https://www.amazon.com/Nautical-Almanac-2024-Year/dp/1951116690/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1IAIAP3U59XSX&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.d3xFA2pQJx8dny0H5kmiZLliYeANWFYB9BZ8He317-pq7X_P5hjJ-aQ5Ir7tAsTHKBmmclCDUVqueJoljDZ8pMVLTCGbF98Xnd4rvuET9FSOXDx-5zcZQXjvqMduNM4eVj7NjN3sq_oBYGavC31cYfErZ1TXimJXSvkgVdloz9g-meALl0_BZklDiJFh33wnJs-aba7SBQyP94c-7bBPn4qIhPGFOMmTE3Y0DZp3CgM.ZlExL1J_IC-osoQXy2XKkMZ3A4CllQRdgOp5Cy7_II8&dib_tag=se&keywords=nautical+almanac&qid=1718006483&sprefix=nautical+almanac%2Caps%2C351&sr=8-1)
New digital versions (for 2025 and onwards) can be prepared using some GitHub code repositories, and I used [this one](https://github.com/aendie/SkyAlmanac-Py3)
