# The Axioms we use for the proofs about Earth shape

## Foundational Axioms

Everyone discussing (or trying to disprove) the [proofs](sphere-proof.md)
presented here must agree to the basic
rules. These are the
**foundational [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom)** that make
scientific reasoning possible about the shape of the Earth.
Leaving out or dismissing this will leave the area
we call **science**. Nothing wrong with that, but then we cannot do the
discussion with the scientific method and the relevant
[epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology)
techniques
([a posteriori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori)
empirical work combined with a priori reasoning)

### **Axiom 1: Reality and Consistency**

- **Physical Reality Exists**:
There is an objective physical world independent of our beliefs about it
- **Consistency Principle**: Physical reality cannot simultaneously
have contradictory properties
- **Translation**: Earth cannot be "both round and flat at the same time" -
these are mutually exclusive geometric properties
- *In addition to this we can add the concept of*
*[object permance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_permanence), i.e. the*
*notion that objects remain even if we for a period of*
*time ceases our observation work.*

### **Axiom 2: Euclidean Geometry (At human-observable scales)**

- **Space is Euclidean**: Space follows
[Euclidean geometric principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry)
- **Straight Lines**: Light travels in straight lines through uniform media
(geometric optics)
- **Translation**: We can use standard geometry and trigonometry to
analyze observations

### **Axiom 3: Measurement Validity**

- **Instruments Work**: Properly calibrated sextants, theodolites, and clocks
provide meaningful data about physical reality
- **Reproducibility**: Independent observers using proper methods get
consistent results
- **Translation**: Measurements (altitudes, clock readings etc) by
different people at different times are valid data

### **Axiom 4: Logical Reasoning**

- **Law of Non-Contradiction**: A statement cannot be both true and
false simultaneously
- **Excluded Middle**: For any geometric property, Earth either has it or
doesn't have it
- **Translation**: Earth is either flat OR curved, spherical OR non-spherical -
not both, not neither

### **Why These Axioms Matter**

**Against [Solipsism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism)**:
*"Maybe nothing is real and it's all in your mind"*

- **Response**: Axiom 1 establishes we're discussing physical reality,
not philosophical metaphysics
- **Rule for our work**: Contestants must make falsifiable predictions about
observable reality

**Against Contradiction**: *"Earth can be round and flat simultaneously"*

- **Response**: Axiom 1 + Axiom 4 - physical properties can't be contradictory
- **Rule for our work**: Each contestant must present a **consistent** geometric
model

**Against Non-Euclidean Escapes**:
*"Maybe space is curved in ways we don't understand"*

- **Response**: Axiom 2 - we're analyzing **local** observations using
**local** geometry
- **Rule for our work**: Proposers of theories can't invoke exotic physics to
explain simple observations

**Against Measurement Denial**: *"How do you know instruments work?"*

- **Response**: Axiom 3 - if we can't trust properly calibrated instruments,
no science is possible
- **Rule for our work**: Proposers of theories must accept valid observational
data as evidence

### **The "Meta-Work" Question**

**If someone rejects these axioms**, they're not really debating Earth's
shape - they're debating whether logical reasoning about physical reality is
possible at all.

**Burden of proof and axiom definitions**: Anyone going in to a confrontation
about the proofs presented are expected to state alternative axioms clearly.

**That will lead to a different discussion entirely**:
Philosophy 101, not geometry.

**Our work assumes**: We're rational agents trying to determine
Earth's actual geometric properties using evidence and logic.

**Translation**: *"Therefore, those who reject these axioms are engaging in
philosophical rather than geometric discourse"*

## Academic Sources

**The philosophical and mathematical foundations supporting geometric proofs**
**of Earth's shape have extensive scholarly backing across multiple**
**academic disciplines.** Research across philosophy of science,
measurement theory, geometric foundations, epistemology, and scientific
methodology reveals convergent support for four crucial axioms: reality's
independence, local Euclidean validity, measurement reliability, and logical
consistency. These sources span from Aristotelian foundations
through contemporary scientific realism, providing both historical depth and
modern authoritative validation.
**The convergence of evidence establishes these axioms as academically robust**
**foundations for rigorous geometric reasoning about Earth's shape.**

### Reality and consistency axiom support

The principle that physical reality exists independently and follows
consistent natural laws finds strongest support in contemporary
**scientific realism literature**. Stathis Psillos's
*Scientific Realism: How Science Tracks Truth* (Routledge, 1999) argues that
successful scientific theories track objective truth about mind-independent
reality, while the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's "Scientific Realism"
entry by Anjan Chakravartty (2022) defines scientific realism as commitment
to "the mind-independent existence of the world investigated by the sciences."

**Karl Popper's contributions remain foundational.**
His *Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach*
(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972) advocates for "objective knowledge"
existing independently of knowing subjects, while
*The Logic of Scientific Discovery* (Routledge, 2002) establishes
falsifiability as the criterion for genuine scientific claims about objective
reality.

Physical consistency principles receive direct support from
**Einstein's invariance principles**, documented across physics literature
including University Physics Volume 3 (OpenStax, 2025) and Physics LibreTexts.
These establish that physical laws remain identical across different
reference frames, demonstrating nature's fundamental consistency.

Classical foundations trace through **Bertrand Russell's
*Our Knowledge of the External World*** (Open Court, 1914), which develops
logical atomism arguing for objective "logical atoms" existing independently of
our knowledge. David Hume's *Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding* (1748),
despite its skeptical conclusions, established conceptual frameworks for
understanding natural laws as uniform regularities operating consistently.

### Euclidean geometry axiom validation  

Mathematical rigor for Euclidean geometry foundations comes from
**David Hilbert's *Grundlagen der Geometrie*** (Foundations of Geometry, 1899),
which establishes rigorous axiomatic foundations proving Euclidean geometry's
logical consistency. MIT's OpenCourseWare materials on
"Locally Euclidean Spaces" provide the mathematical concept that manifolds are
"locally Euclidean," meaning sufficiently small neighborhoods in curved spaces
appear flat and follow Euclidean principles.

**Differential geometry sources** demonstrate local Euclidean validity at human
scales. University of Pennsylvania's "Lecture Notes on Riemannian Geometry"
shows that Riemannian manifolds modeling curved spaces are locally approximated
by Euclidean spaces, with "circles and triangles behaving like Euclidean
circles and triangles" at small scales. John M. Lee's
*Introduction to Riemannian Manifolds* (Springer, 2018) provides definitive
treatment of this mathematical framework.

Light propagation principles receive comprehensive support from
**geometric optics literature**. The RP Photonics Encyclopedia confirms that
"in homogeneous optical materials, light rays are straight lines,"
while Physics LibreTexts establishes that "the law of rectilinear propagation
states that light in a homogeneous medium travels along straight-line paths
called rays."

Classical mechanics foundations appear in
**University of Texas physics materials** showing that "Newton very
deliberately modeled his approach in the Principia on that taken in
Euclid's Elements," assuming "position in space, distance in space, and
position as a function of time in space are correctly described by Euclidean
vector algebra."

### Measurement validity foundations

**The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's "Measurement in Science"**
by Eran Tal (2023) provides definitive philosophical treatment, establishing
that measurement validity depends on proper calibration and theoretical
grounding. It details how measurement incorporates corrections for systematic
effects through calibration, requiring "background assumptions about the
workings of the instrument and its interactions with the object and
environment."

Reproducibility receives authoritative treatment from the **National Academies'
*Reproducibility and Replicability in Science*** (2019), which defines
reproducibility as "obtaining consistent results using the same input data,
computational steps, methods, and code." This definitive consensus document
represents the highest level of scientific authority on reproducibility
standards.

**International metrology standards** provide direct institutional support
through the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), established by
the Metre Convention in 1875 with 64 member states. BIPM's mission
"to provide the basis for a single, coherent system of measurements throughout
the world, traceable to the International System of Units" demonstrates how
proper calibration enables measurements to become "direct realizations" of
SI units.

Classical measurement theory traces through
**Norman Robert Campbell's *Physics: The Elements***
(Cambridge University Press, 1920), which established fundamental measurement
theory arguing that proper measurement requires ordering and concatenation
operations satisfying mathematical axioms.
**David Krantz et al.'s *Foundations of Measurement*** (Academic Press, 1971)
provides the most influential mathematical theory, establishing that
measurement validity depends on homomorphic mappings between empirical and
numerical relational structures.

### Logical reasoning axiom authority

**Aristotelian foundations remain definitive.** The Stanford Encyclopedia's
"Aristotle on Non-contradiction" by Paula Gottlieb (2019) establishes that
"without the principle of non-contradiction we could not know anything that
we do know" and "the principle of non-contradiction is a principle of
scientific inquiry, reasoning and communication that we cannot do without."
**Aristotle's Metaphysics Book IV** originally established the Law of
Non-Contradiction as "the most secure of all principles."

**Mathematical foundations** receive comprehensive treatment through Russell
and Whitehead's *Principia Mathematica*, documented in Encyclopedia Britannica
entries showing how these works
"lay bare the logical foundations of mathematics" using fundamental
logical principles. The Stanford Encyclopedia's "Philosophy of Mathematics" by
Øystein Linnebo (2018) establishes how mathematical knowledge is "acquired by
deduction from basic principles" relying on logical principles like
non-contradiction as foundational axioms.

**Encyclopedia Britannica's "Laws of thought"** by Brian Duignan defines the
three fundamental laws: "(1) the law of contradiction,
(2) the law of excluded middle, and (3) the principle of identity,"
explaining that "Aristotle cited the laws of contradiction and of
excluded middle as examples of axioms."

Modern applications appear in **scientific methodology literature** showing
that deductive reasoning fundamental to science depends entirely on logical
principles like non-contradiction, where "it is impossible for the premises to
be true and the conclusion to be false." The hypothetico-deductive method
requires theories to be "falsifiable" through logical contradiction.

### Cross-cutting academic support

Several themes strengthen support across all axioms. **Convergent validation**
appears where independent disciplines reach similar conclusions - physics
invariance principles supporting consistency, differential geometry supporting
local Euclidean validity, and measurement theory supporting instrumental
reliability. **Historical continuity** shows these principles maintained
scholarly support from classical antiquity through contemporary research.

**Institutional authority** spans premier universities
(MIT, Stanford, University of Pennsylvania), international organizations
(BIPM, National Academies), and established publishers
(Routledge, Cambridge University Press, Springer). **Methodological diversity**
encompasses mathematical proof, philosophical argument, empirical validation,
and consensual authority.

### Conclusion: establishing rigorous foundations

The research reveals **overwhelming scholarly consensus** supporting these four
foundational axioms across multiple academic disciplines. From Aristotle's
logical principles through Einstein's physical invariants to contemporary
measurement theory, authoritative sources provide convergent validation for the
philosophical and mathematical foundations underlying geometric reasoning about
Earth's shape.

**These sources collectively establish that rigorous geometric proofs rest on**
**academically sound foundations** - mind-independent reality following
consistent laws, locally Euclidean spatial geometry, reliable calibrated
measurements, and valid logical reasoning. The breadth of authoritative support,
spanning foundational classics through contemporary scholarship, provides
robust academic grounding for empirical geometric investigations while
remaining accessible to educated readers engaged in scientific discourse.

## A note on microphysics (quantum mechanics)

The axioms given here apply to macro phenomena, in particular on the scale
of celestial objects. Microphysics and
[quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics)
exhibit other properties and the axioms given here might not be
fully applicable (in particular axiom 4).
We ignore this in the context used here.
