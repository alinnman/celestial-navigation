# The Axioms we use for the proofs about Earth shape

## Foundational Axioms

Everyone discussing (or trying to disprove) the [proofs](shphere-proof.md)
presented here must agree to the basic
rules. These are the **foundational axioms** that make
logical reasoning possible. Leaving out or dissmissing this will leave the area
we call **science**. Nothing wrong with that, but then we cannot do the
discussion with the scientific method and the basic episthemology
techniques (a posteriori empirical work combined with a priori reasoning)

### **Axiom 1: Reality and Consistency**

- **Physical Reality Exists**:
There is an objective physical world independent of our beliefs about it
- **Consistency Principle**: Physical reality cannot simultaneously
have contradictory properties
- **Translation**: Earth cannot be "both round and flat at the same time" -
these are mutually exclusive geometric properties

### **Axiom 2: Euclidean Geometry (Local)**

- **Space is Euclidean**: Space follows Euclidean geometric principles
- **Straight Lines**: Light travels in straight lines through uniform media
(geometric optics)
- **Translation**: We can use standard geometry and trigonometry to
analyze observations

### **Axiom 3: Measurement Validity**

- **Instruments Work**: Properly calibrated sextants, theodolites, and clocks
provide meaningful data about physical reality
- **Reproducibility**: Independent observers using proper methods get
consistent results
- **Translation**: Polaris altitude measurements by different people at
different times are valid data

### **Axiom 4: Logical Reasoning**

- **Law of Non-Contradiction**: A statement cannot be both true and
false simultaneously
- **Excluded Middle**: For any geometric property, Earth either has it or
doesn't have it
- **Translation**: Earth is either flat OR curved, spherical OR non-spherical -
not both, not neither

### **Why These Axioms Matter**

**Against Solipsism**: *"Maybe nothing is real and it's all in your mind"*

- **Response**: Axiom 1 establishes we're discussing physical reality,
not philosophical metaphysics
- **Tournament Rule**: Contestants must make falsifiable predictions about
observable reality

**Against Contradiction**: *"Earth can be round and flat simultaneously"*

- **Response**: Axiom 1 + Axiom 4 - physical properties can't be contradictory
- **Tournament Rule**: Each contestant must present a **consistent** geometric
model

**Against Non-Euclidean Escapes**:
*"Maybe space is curved in ways we don't understand"*

- **Response**: Axiom 2 - we're analyzing **local** observations using
**local** geometry
- **Tournament Rule**: Proposers of theories can't invoke exotic physics to
explain simple observations

**Against Measurement Denial**: *"How do you know instruments work?"*

- **Response**: Axiom 3 - if we can't trust properly calibrated instruments,
no science is possible
- **Tournament Rule**: Proposers of theories must accept valid observational
data as evidence

### **The "Meta-Tournament" Question**

**If someone rejects these axioms**, they're not really debating Earth's
shape - they're debating whether logical reasoning about physical reality is
possible at all.

**That will lead to a different discussion entirely**:
Philosophy 101, not geometry.

**Our work assumes**: We're rational agents trying to determine
Earth's actual geometric properties using evidence and logic.

**Translation**: *"If you don't accept that physical reality exists and can
be measured, you're not qualified to enter a scientific discussion about
Earth geometry.
Go argue with philosophers instead."*
