# Proof 1: Celestial Altitude Formula Uniquely Determines Spherical Earth

## Problem Statement

Given the observational formula for celestial object altitude:
$$a = 90 - \frac{d}{111.1}$$

Where:
- $a$ = altitude of celestial object (degrees)
- $d$ = distance from observer to GP (km)  
- $GP$ = geographical position (point where object is at zenith)

**Prove that this relationship can only occur on a spherical Earth with very distant celestial objects.**

## Theorem

The linear relationship $a = 90 - \frac{d}{111.1}$ uniquely determines that Earth must be spherical with radius approximately 6371 km.

## Proof

### Step 1: Define the Constraint

For ANY point on Earth's surface at distance $d$ from the GP of a celestial object, the altitude follows:
$$a = 90 - \frac{d}{111.1}$$

This must hold for ALL observers at ALL possible distances $d$ from any GP.

### Step 2: Geometric Interpretation

The altitude $a$ represents the angle between the local horizontal plane and the line to the celestial object. For distant objects, this equals the angle between:
- The local normal to Earth's surface (zenith direction)
- The direction from GP to observer (both projected from Earth's center)

### Step 3: Surface Curvature Constraint

For the linear relationship to hold universally, consider three points:
- GP (geographical position)
- Observer $P_1$ at distance $d_1$ 
- Observer $P_2$ at distance $d_2$

The difference in altitude angles must equal:
$$\Delta a = \frac{d_2 - d_1}{111.1}$$

This means the **angular separation** between any two points, as measured from Earth's center, must be exactly proportional to their surface distance with constant $111.1$ km/degree.

### Step 4: Uniqueness of Spherical Geometry

This constant ratio between arc length and central angle $(s = r\theta)$ is the **defining property** of a sphere with radius $r$.

For ANY other surface:
- **Ellipsoid**: The ratio $\frac{s}{\theta}$ varies with position (different curvature)
- **Flat surface**: No central angle exists; altitude relationships are trigonometric, not linear
- **Cylindrical surface**: Ratio constant in one direction only, varies in the other
- **Any irregular surface**: Ratio varies continuously with position and direction

### Step 5: Mathematical Derivation

On a sphere of radius $R$:
- Arc length: $s = R\theta$ (where $\theta$ is in radians)
- Converting to degrees: $s = R \times \frac{\pi}{180} \times \theta_{\text{degrees}}$
- Therefore: $\theta_{\text{degrees}} = s \times \frac{180}{\pi R}$

For our formula: $a = 90 - \frac{d}{111.1}$ to match $a = 90 - \theta$:
$$\frac{180}{\pi R} = \frac{1}{111.1}$$

Therefore: 
$$R = \frac{180 \times 111.1}{\pi} \approx 6371 \text{ km}$$

### Step 6: Rigorous Conclusion

Since the relationship $a = 90 - \frac{d}{111.1}$ demands that $\frac{s}{\theta} = \text{constant} = 111.1$ km/degree for ALL points and ALL directions on Earth's surface, and this property uniquely defines a sphere, Earth must be spherical with radius $R = \frac{111.1 \times 180}{\pi} \approx 6371$ km.

## QED

The observed linear relationship between celestial altitude and distance from GP can **ONLY** occur on a perfect sphere of radius approximately 6371 km, with celestial objects at effectively infinite distance.

## Additional Requirements

This proof also confirms that:
1. **Celestial objects must be very distant** - Otherwise parallax effects would break the linear relationship
2. **Earth's radius is constrained** - The coefficient $111.1$ uniquely determines $R \approx 6371$ km
3. **Surface must be perfectly spherical** - Any deviation from spherical geometry would violate the constant ratio requirement
