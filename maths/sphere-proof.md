# Rigorous proof of Earth sphericity

1000 years ago we knew a lot less about science, but we had already quite a good grasp of the shape of the Earth. 
The spherical shape of the Earth was first discovered in antiquity by Greek scholars, and then passed over to Romans and Arabs. 
In [this article](https://earthform.linnman.net/the-earth-is-a-sphere-and-it-can-easily-be-proved) I give a simple explanation of two of the most fundamental experiments for determining the **spherical** shape of the Earth:
**Celestial Navigation** and **Al-Biruni's experiment**.

The article can be summarized as the experimental findings which are given here as **a posterori** (observational) knowledge.

1. The altitude of any celestial object increases 1 degree for each 111.1 km you travel towards its GP. 
1. There is a dip of the horizon and it follows this formula: $\Theta ≈ 1.93 \times \sqrt{h}$ <br>
   (where θ is dip in arcminutes, h is elevation in meters)

From this you can do the reasoning **a priori** (using maths) to prove that the findings above are **only possible on a sphere**

I present here two rigorous proofs for this:

[1. Proof that Eratosthenes assumption and Celestial Navigation only works on a sphere](sphere-proof.1.md) <br>
[2. Proof that Al-Biruni's finding and the square root relation of dip and elevation only works on a sphere](sphere-proof.2.md)

1000 years ago this could have earned a "PhD" or similar in the academic world. Today this is very basic science, 
but presented here as a counter-argument against pseudoscience advocating a Flat Earth.

Confronting the proofs given above can be done in two ways:

1. Refuting the observational findings (a posteriori), preferrably through producing well-documented and peer-reviewed experimental results ("no horizon dip", "refute the linear relation of the altitude of celestial objects").
2. Refuting the mathematical proofs (a priori). Then you will have to wrestle against titans such as [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss).

I leave it here for anyone to use.
