# Rigorous proof of Earth sphericity

1000 years ago we knew a lot less about science, but we had already quite a
good grasp of the shape of the Earth.
The spherical shape of the Earth was first established in antiquity by
Greek scholars through some very strong observations and conjectures,
and then passed over to Romans and Arabs.
In
[this "pop-science" article](https://earthform.linnman.net/the-earth-is-a-sphere-and-it-can-easily-be-proved)
I give a simple explanation of two of the oldest and most fundamental
experiments for determining the **spherical** shape of the Earth:
**Celestial Navigation** and **Al-Biruni's experiment**.

The article can be summarized as the experimental findings which are given
here as
[**a posterori**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#A_posteriori)
(observational) knowledge.

1. The altitude of any celestial object increases 1 degree for each 111.1 km
you travel towards its
[GP](https://www.britannica.com/technology/ground-position)
(Celestial Navigation / Eratosthenes)
1. There is a dip of the horizon and it follows this formula:
$\Theta â‰ˆ 1.93 \times \sqrt{h}$ <br>
   (where $\Theta$ is dip in arcminutes, $h$ is elevation in meters) (Al-Biruni)

From this you start reasoning
[**a priori**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#A_priori)
(using maths in this case) to prove that the findings above are
**only possible on a sphere**.

*The method used is typical for basic science:*
*First find observable facts in nature with predictable outcomes, then try to*
*fit them into a model and/or make a priori reasoning to draw conclusions.*

I present here two rigorous proofs for this:

[1. Proof that Eratosthenes assumption and Celestial Navigation **only works on a sphere**](sphere-proof.1.md)
<br>
[2. Proof that Al-Biruni's finding and the square root relation of dip and elevation **only works on a sphere**](sphere-proof.2.md)

Before going through this you may also read about the
[fundamental axioms](axioms.md)
you need to consider before engaging with the proofs.

1000 years ago this could have earned a "PhD" or similar in the academic world.
Today this is very basic science,
but presented here as counter-arguments against pseudoscience advocating a
Flat Earth.

Confronting the proofs given above can be done in two ways:

1. Refuting the observational findings (a posteriori),
preferrably through producing well-documented and peer-reviewed experimental
results ("no horizon dip",
"refute the linear relation of the altitude of celestial objects").
2. If you fail in step 1 above:
Refuting the mathematical proofs (a priori). Then you will have to wrestle
against titans such as
[Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss).

I say Good Luck to anyone accepting the challenge to do such a confrontation!

I leave it here for anyone to use.
