# Rigorous proof of Earth sphericity

## Two proofs

1000 years ago we knew a lot less about science, but we had already quite a
good grasp of the shape of the Earth.
The spherical shape of the Earth was first established in antiquity by
Greek scholars through some very strong observations and conjectures,
and then passed over to Romans and Arabs.
In
[this "pop-science" article](https://earthform.linnman.net/the-earth-is-a-sphere-and-it-can-easily-be-proved)
I give a simple explanation of two of the oldest and most fundamental
experiments for determining the **spherical** shape of the Earth:
**Celestial Navigation** and **Al-Biruni's experiment**.

The article can be summarized as the experimental findings which are given
here as
[**a posteriori**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#A_posteriori)
(observational) knowledge.

1. The altitude of any celestial object increases 1 degree for each 111.1 km
you travel towards its
[GP](https://www.britannica.com/technology/ground-position)
(Celestial Navigation / Eratosthenes)
1. There is a dip of the horizon and it follows this approximate formula:
$\Theta ≈ 1.85 \times \sqrt{h}$ <br>
   (where $\Theta$ is dip in arcminutes, $h$ is elevation in meters) (Al-Biruni)

The relations stated above describe falsifiable empirical patterns. We can clearly see in our data
that measurements of altitudes and horizon dip seem to follow a predifined pattern. 
This is not a **truth** in itself, but it is the result of systematically evaluating
a posteriori observations. 

From this you start reasoning
[**a priori**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#A_priori)
(using mathematical deduction) to prove that the
findings above **uniquely indicate a spherical Earth**.

Let us denote the empirical (a posteriori) findings with $E$, 
and the conclusion that the Earth is a sphere with $S$. 
It is straightforward to show that $S\Rightarrow{E}$—that is, if the Earth is spherical,
these observations follow necessarily. However, the crucial step is establishing the converse: 
$E\Rightarrow{S}$, meaning these observations can *only* occur on a sphere, thereby ruling out any other possible shape. Together, these establish $E\Leftrightarrow{S}$—the observations are both necessary and sufficient for sphericity.

*The method used is typical for basic science:*
*First find observable facts in nature with predictable outcomes, then try to*
*fit them into a model and/or make a priori reasoning to draw conclusions.*

I present here two rigorous proofs for this:

[1. Proof that Eratosthenes assumption and Celestial Navigation **are uniquely consistent with a sphere**](sphere-proof.1.md)<br/>
[2. Proof that Al-Biruni's finding and the square root relation of dip and elevation
**are uniquely consistent with a sphere**](sphere-proof.2.md)

Before going through this you may also read about the
[fundamental axioms](axioms.md)
you need to consider before engaging with the proofs.

1000 years ago this could have earned a "PhD" or similar in the academic world.
Today this is very basic science,
but presented here as counter-arguments against pseudoscience advocating a
Flat Earth.

Confronting the proofs given above can be done in three possible ways:

1. Falsifying (refuting) the observational findings (a posteriori),
preferably through independently verified
results giving other results from what we have found.<br/> ("there is no horizon dip",
"the altitude of celestial object do not follow the linear pattern").
2. If you fail in step 1 above:
Refuting the mathematical proofs (a priori) where we concluded the spherical shape. 
Then you will have to confront mathematics and geometry all the way from
antiquity ([Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid))
to differential geometry of the 19th century
([Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss)).
3. If steps 1 or 2 fail you may go to the [axioms](axioms.md) in order to
use other fundamental epistemological views and maybe formulate new axioms.  
Rejecting the presented axioms would require proposing an entirely different mathematical
framework or epistemology.

I say Good Luck to anyone accepting the challenge to do such a confrontation!

I leave it here for anyone to use.

## Giving feedback

The proofs given here were drafted quite recently (september 2025) and there
may be both logical and mathematical errors.
If you find anything then please feel free to add a PR (Pull Request) vs this
document.

If you find the proofs fundamentally **incorrect**,
maybe indicating a proposed Flat Earth or similar then I advise you to
contact the
