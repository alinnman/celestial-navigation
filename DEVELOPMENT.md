# Some notes on development

## A virtual environment (venv)

This code was developed with
[VSCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code) on a Linux (Ubuntu)
machine.

The Python environment has been installed in a
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/venv.html)
to allow for control of all dependencies and libraries.
This is placed in the <tt>.venv</tt> subfolder.

In order to create this environment you should execute these commands:

    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install pandas
    pip install jupyter
    pip install folium
    pip install offline_folium
    python -m offline_folium
    pip install kivy

After having created this you can use VSCode to define
this as your python environment using Ctrl-Shift-P
and selecting this as your Python interpreter.

## The .gitignore file

The file [.gitignore](.gitignore) contains several exclusion
patterns in order to not check in these files into git:

* The .venv (see above)
* Python cache files
* Jupyter temp files
* Test scripts (anything with a name beginning with <tt>testing</tt>)
* HTML and JSON files (these are produced as map output by Folium)

You may of course edit the git ignore file to adjust to your needs.

## Test scripts

The files in the [test](test) folder contain unit tests which can
be run in VSCode testing module.

## App development and deployment

The file [main.py](main.py) contains a very simple
app (Celeste) built on the Kivy framework. It can be used as a starter point
for developing Android or iOS apps.

A script solution based on [buildozer](https://github.com/kivy/buildozer)
is available and it produces a working/running app (APK file) for Android 15.
In order to use it you need to follow the installation instructions.
Be careful to keep your work in the virtual environment (venv). See above.

Building the app is done using these commands:

    source .venv/bin/activate
    buildozer -v android debug

Note however that you probably need to fine-tune and adjust your enviroment carefully before being able to run the app build script successfully.

## App testing

Check
[this&nbsp;folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QFcncVEuCQMnls8lyNElDtpTYruMgI0D?usp=drive_link)
for a list of compiled APK files. These apps should run nicely
but have limited functionality (mapping support may be missing). 
At the moment I have not yet finalized publishing on Google Play.
