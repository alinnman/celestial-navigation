# Contributing to the project

Anyone is invited to contribute to this project,
either by supplying sight reduction algorithm-related material,
including improvements of the existing code.

Actual sights are also welcome, in addition to the samples provided.

I have started a [discussion forum](https://github.com/alinnman/celestial-navigation/discussions)
where anyone is invited to discuss anything related to celestial navigation.

# Future plans

Regarding future plans for this project. These are some things I may consider doing.

1. Create machine-readable Nautical Almanac
1. Create a lightweight web application and/or mobile app. <br/>
*A collection of simple Jupyter notebooks have been added, and this may be good enough for practical work.*
1. More elaborate sextant calibration code.

But the design goal is **portability and a small footprint**,
with no dependency on an internet connection.
Keeping it runnable in a lightweigth Python environment is desirable,
with the mobile phone as the natural choice of hardware.

I may also consider improving on accuracy by more elaborate work on geodesics
(Earth oblateness).

Any contributions are welcome!
